I am using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this blog. The static HTML content is generated from the Markdown text using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).  

The typical work flow is:

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Push changes to GitHub 
3. [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) detects changes and generates the HTML using Pelican
